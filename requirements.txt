# PanoLLaVA Requirements
# =====================

# --- Core Frameworks ---
# pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision==0.22.1 torchaudio==2.7.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
torch>=1.12.0
transformers>=4.20.0
lightning>=2.0.0
# Make sure to install cuda-toolkit 11.8 or higher for GPU support
mamba-ssm>=1.2.0

# --- Performance Optimization (Optional but Recommended) ---
# Flash Attention 2: 메모리 ~30% 절감, 속도 ~2배 향상 (Ampere+ GPU 필요)
# 설치: pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
# 요구사항: CUDA 11.8+, PyTorch 2.0+, Ampere GPU (A100, RTX 30xx 이상)
# flash-attn>=2.0.0  # 선택적 (자동 감지 및 fallback to SDPA)

# --- Hugging Face Ecosystem ---
accelerate
sentencepiece
peft>=0.6.0  # Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA, AdaLoRA, etc.)
safetensors   # Safe and fast tensor serialization

# --- Data & Utilities ---
py360convert  # For 360-degree image processing
omegaconf    # For configuration management
Pillow       # For image processing (PIL.Image)
PyYAML       # For parsing config/*.yaml files
numpy        # Fundamental package for scientific computing
packaging    # Version parsing needed by transformers

pandas       # For data processing
matplotlib   # For visualization
opencv-python-headless  # For image processing (headless for server environments)
scikit-learn  # For evaluation metrics

# --- Evaluation Metrics ---
sacrebleu              # For standardized BLEU scores (preferred)
nltk                   # For METEOR scores (+ BLEU fallback)
rouge-score            # For ROUGE metrics
sentence-transformers  # For semantic similarity/SPICE fallback
pycocoevalcap          # For COCO evaluation metrics (SPICE, CIDEr)
wandb                  # For experiment tracking
qwen-vl-utils          # For Qwen2.5-VL models (optional)
